    "### Many models, many different projections\n",
    "From a set of climate model runs many different climate conditions are projected. One reason for this variation is the difference in emissions in the atmosphere that cause global warming. Another reason is that even within a similar emission scenario, different models behave differently because they represent the Earth’s climate system differently. Since there is imperfect knowledge, models have varying assumptions, simplifications and parameters, leading to varying outcomes. Lastly, there is what we call internal variability. This means that even for a projection with a similar emission scenario and the same climate model, there can be a different projection. This is due to the natural randomness of the weather. This randomness is especially present when considering changes at short time scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the mid-century, some models might project significant droughts in a specific region, while another projection might show limited change in the same region. However, both are plausible scenarios. Here, we show to gain insight into these these uncertainties.\n"

    "### Emission scenarios\n",
    "One way to analyse the group of projections from GCMs is by averaging the projections per emission scenario. Emission scenarios like RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) and SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) are used to predict how the climate will change in the future due to human greenhouse gas emissions. These scenarios are often found in climate risk datasets and also used often in the CLIMAAX workflows. A key strength of these scenarios is their focus on human-caused changes. To make the predictions more reliable, scientists average the results from multiple climate models, which helps smooth out uncertainties and natural climate variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, averaging also dampens the change signal. Different climate models predict different and sometimes opposite changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, even with the same emissions levels, leading to a wide range of possible outcomes. By averaging the model projections, some important details can get lost.\n"

So, for each model we assess when this given GWL is reached, we retrieve the climate model data and assess the climate change signal for all climate variables of interest. This offers a simpler, outcome-focused way to assess climate change impacts. Instead of focusing on uncertain emissions pathways, GWLs allow us to directly explore the risks associated with different levels of warming, which can be more intuitive for planning and decision-making. This approach sidesteps some of the uncertainties tied to future emissions and helps focus on the temperature outcomes that matter most for adaptation.

We notice that that the individual model projections span a much larger range of change than the  SSP averaged scenarios. Here we see that individual models behave differently towards the same emission scenarios. This can be either due to differences in the way they represent physical processes or because they are subject to randomness of the weather and might have hit a cold snap or dry spell in their simulations.\n",

Individual model projections all indicate an increase in spring precipitation, yet the amount is more unclear. When analysing what could happen in the future we see that in each SSP small increases can occur (<5%) while high increases (>15%) only occur under high emission scenarios. When using this information with known flood mechanisms where soils are saturated and extra rain leads to high discharges, we can expect more of these events to occur. An increase of 10% extra precipitation in the spring season is not unlikely across models and can lead to severe changes in discharges.\n",

Given that Northern Europe historically received roughly 1.3 mm/day of snow in winter the range given is between a 24% reduction to a 7% increase in snowfall. Few models project an increase and this might only be due to randomness of weather. However, 7% extra snowfall in winter snowpack can result into large changes in melt discharges and might be worth investigating as a potential ‘what if’ scenario. A reduction of 24% is also interesting as it greatly limits snow accumulation and therefore the snow melt flood mechanism.\n",

However, it is reported that in the winter half year, NEU is likely to have increased mean precipitation associated with increased atmospheric moisture and moisture convergence, and intensification in extratropical cyclone activity (Page: 72, Reference: IPCC_AR6_WGI_Atlas). The changes in precipitation are driven by the increase in atmospheric water vapour (about 7% per 1°C of warming near the surface), although this is modulated by various dynamical changes. Changes in average precipitation are also driven by slower processes that constrain future changes over the globe to only 2-3% per 1°C of warming near the surface (Page: 96, Reference: IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter11). The differences across climate models are due to pronounced internal variability in this region, particularly NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) and AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation). The spread in climate model projections is still substantial, partly due to these factors (Page: 72, Reference: IPCC_AR6_WGI_Atlas). Additionally, near-term projected changes in precipitation are uncertain mainly because of natural internal variability, model uncertainty, and uncertainty in natural and anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Page: 33, Reference: IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter04). However, without more specific information about spring precipitation in NEU, there is not enough info to answer the question fully.\"\n",

The NAO, for instance, is the main mode of climate variability over the North Atlantic-European region in all seasons, affecting temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and even the occurrence of extreme weather events (Page: 4, Reference: IPCC_AR6_WGI_AnnexIV). It can also lead to significant uncertainty in future changes of regional climate, as seen in the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario where an increased amplitude and frequency of the NAO during winter is associated with higher precipitation in northern Europe and lower precipitation in southern Europe (Page: 81, Reference: IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter08). The AMO, while not explicitly described in the provided information, is another mode of climate variability that can influence climate model projections. The spread in climate model projections refers to the range of possible outcomes predicted by different climate models. This spread is substantial, meaning there is a wide range of possible future climates predicted by these models, partly due to the influence of internal variability factors like the NAO and AMO (Page: 72, Reference: IPCC_AR6_WGI_Atlas). However, it's also noted that some climate models may have deficiencies that cause the predictable signal associated with the NAO to be weaker than in nature, while others, such as that linked to the SAM, are more consistent with observations (Page: 12, Reference: IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter04).

This is because regional warming is virtually certain to extend the observed downward trends in snow accumulation, snow water equivalent, and length of the snow cover season in NEU (Page:76, Reference:IPCC_AR6_WGI_Atlas). This is supported by regional and global multi-model and/or single-model ensemble projections including CMIP5, PRUDENCE, ENSEMBLES, and EURO-CORDEX. The changes are attributed to changes in the snowfall fraction of precipitation and to increased snowmelt (Page:76, Reference:IPCC_AR6_WGI_Atlas). The differences across climate models can be due to the different ways they represent physical processes and their interactions. For example, Terzago et al. (2017) showed a large positive bias in the amplitude of the annual snow cycle of EURO-CORDEX 0.11° simulations driven by GCM projections, while reanalysis-driven RCMs showed good agreement with in situ observations (Page:76, Reference:IPCC_AR6_WGI_Atlas). Furthermore, changes in precipitation extremes (including both rainfall and snowfall extremes) can differ drastically from those in average precipitation. The intensification of extreme precipitation is driven by the increase in atmospheric water vapour (about 7% per 1°C of warming near the surface), although this is modulated by various dynamical changes. In contrast, changes in average precipitation are driven not only by moisture increases but also by slower processes that constrain future changes over the globe to only 2-3% per 1°C of warming near the surface (Page:96, Reference:IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter11). In summary, the expected changes in NEU for average snowfall amounts in winter are likely to decrease due to global warming, and the differences across climate models can be attributed to the different ways they represent physical processes and their interactions (In-house knowledge).\"\n",

Stochastic Weather Generators also provide a method to increase the length of your time-series enabling extreme value analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Action: Use a stochastic weather generator to blend the climate signals from the models with observed historical weather data. This process can mimic how variables like temperature and precipitation might shift, while preserving local conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use these projections in combination with socioeconomic changes\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Why it matters*: The severity and impact of climate change depend not just on the physical climate but also on how societies evolve. Integrating climate projections with different socioeconomic scenarios allows for more holistic scenarios, reflecting changes in population, technology, and governance that either increase or decrease vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Action*: Combine your climate model outputs with scenarios of regional socioeconomic development. For example, increased precipitation combined with rapid urban growth may result in higher risks than the same climate future with strong policy intervention and innovation. Use such combinations to explore how risks might change based on both climate and socioeconomic dynamics."
